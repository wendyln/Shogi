  Our project is a shogi game providing 1 or 2 player gameplay with two gamemodes. Shogi is a chess-style game that originated
  from Japan. The interface will show a Shogi board represented with symbols on a terminal 
  window, with all the pieces on and off the board. The project will allow for a two player 
  game (Player against Player) with automatic move checking. Players will be able to move 
  their pieces by inputting the algebraic notation corresponding to their intended move, 
  replace captured pieces onto the board. Illegal moves will not be permitted, and when under check 
  the player will receive an additional warning. In 1 player mode, the player would be able to play
  against an AI that is optimised with the minimax algorithm. In the gamemode crazyshogi, all rules are 
  out of the table as players face off, with there being a chance of a random move being made each turn.
